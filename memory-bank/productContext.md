This project aims to create an interactive web application called "newsfabric" that allows users to design and preview newsletter layouts. The application will provide a drag-and-drop interface, pre-designed templates, a library of components, real-time preview functionality, responsive design, options for custom CSS/HTML, and save/export features. The goal is to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience, similar to popular email design tools.
